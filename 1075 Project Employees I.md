Write an SQL query that reports the **average** experience years of all the employees for each project, **rounded to 2 digits**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50
```

# MySQL

```sql
-- 选择项目ID和计算每个项目员工平均工作年限
SELECT
    p.project_id, -- 项目ID
    round(avg(e.experience_years), 2) as average_years -- 计算平均工作年限，保留两位小数
FROM
    Project p -- 从项目表中
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee e -- 左连接员工表
ON
    p.employee_id = e.employee_id -- 基于员工ID连接
GROUP BY
    p.project_id -- 根据项目ID分组
```
