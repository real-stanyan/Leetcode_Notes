Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.
Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.

```

Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**
