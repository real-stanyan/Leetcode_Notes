Table: `Views`

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |

There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date.
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.

```

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |

# MySQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
    author_id AS id   -- 选择唯一的author_id，并将其别名设置为id
FROM 
    Views             -- 从Views表中选择
WHERE 
    author_id = viewer_id  -- 条件：作者ID等于查看者ID
ORDER BY 
    id;                -- 根据id进行排序
```
